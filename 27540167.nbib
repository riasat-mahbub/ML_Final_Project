AB  - Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, 
      hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve 
      them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for 
      estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution 
      satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African 
      countries--Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda--we show how a 
      convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can 
      explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, 
      which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and 
      target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine 
      learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, 
      suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.
